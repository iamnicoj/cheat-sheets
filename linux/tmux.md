# tmux

tmux is a program which runs in a terminal and allows multiple other terminal programs to be run inside it  for **Linux ([[linux]])**. Each program inside tmux gets its own terminal managed by tmux, which can be accessed from the single terminal where tmux is running - this called multiplexing and tmux is a terminal multiplexer.

The main uses of tmux are to:

-   Protect running programs on a remote server from connection drops by running them inside tmux.
    
-   Allow programs running on a remote server to be accessed from multiple different local computers.
    
-   Work with multiple programs and shells together in one terminal, a bit like a window manager.
